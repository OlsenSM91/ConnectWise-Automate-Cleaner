# ConnectWise-Automate-Cleaner
Changed MSPs and needed to re-deploy ConnectWise automate. Created this script to check to see if Automate was previously installed, if it was it will run the general uninstaller and then after will run the generic installer. Be sure to remove the Agent_Installer.exe and replace with your own otherwise we'll have a remote on your computer...

Don't run this with the Agent_Install or you're going to have a bad time. Made for CNS/Rx-TEK
